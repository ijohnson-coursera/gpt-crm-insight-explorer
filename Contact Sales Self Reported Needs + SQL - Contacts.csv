I am a learning advisor working at Shared Services Canada. We want to launch a pilot on a new learning journey that would involve a Coursera license. 
We want to start the pilot very soon, in the first week of November, and finish it by mid-December at the latest. 
-We aim for 30 participants 
-License type : Coursera Plus Mensuel (2 months), unless you would have another plan recommendation that would be more interesting for our situation.  

Would it be possible to get a quote for this purchase? Considering the short timelines of this pilot and since it?s the first time we?ll work together, I wanted to know what do you think would be the simplest way to proceed with the granting of these licenses? 
Thank you for your valuable collaboration,"

This is Roberta Manca, the HireSkilling Program Manager at Workfully.

I'm contacting you because your service seems to be exactly what we are looking for. 

We are a Barcelona-based startup offering a decentralized recruitment and upskilling marketplace to the fastest growing tech companies. Our aim is to fill the gap between companies' need for tech professionals and the shortage of that kind of profiles. 

For this we use our HireSkilling Program to help those companies hire and develop the best entry-level talent for their needs. Here is how the program works: 

After getting entry-levels hired in the client company, we conduct a 4-6 week customized and intensive training in live mode with a lead trainer. 
The trainer conducts the lesson part time, and assigns practical tasks for the afternoon, remaining available to the students. 
All this takes place within our platform, which allows uploading all the materials and exercises, as well as evaluating and tracking the participant?s progress. 
The training stage is followed by 3-month technical coaching to support the juniors in their job.

So far we have cooperated with a number of well-known tech companies like Eidosmedia, TravelPerk, The Cocktail, Accenture, etc.  

Currently we want to integrate our platform with infinite quality content so that our trainers can create a customized path for the learners using a diverse content library. 

For this very purpose, we are contacting you because you have exactly that kind of a rich library with high-quality courses that might interest us. So we would like to understand if and how we could possibly integrate your content into our platform. 

If you think there might be a possibility of collaboration, I would be really happy to have a meeting with you  so we can discuss the details. 

Thank you for your attention and I really hope to hear back from you.

Kind regards,
Roberta Manca"

I look after our European colleagues, who number around 400, and we are interested in purchasing some licenses for 2023 and I would like to understand pricing and logisitics please.  For example, can we purchase, say, 100 and allocate/re-allocate them as we desire?  Or do we have to name people and the license stays with them for a year?
Keen to make a purchase (if we have the desired flexibility in allocation) before year-end.
Thanks,

I?d like to speak with someone about the potential of my company partnering with Coursera to inspire people to achieve and be rewarded with your courses.

BI WORLDWIDE inspires people to deliver results for some of the largest Global 2,000 corporations in over 140 countries. One piece of the inspiration puzzle is the rewards people earn when those results are achieved. Participants earn points by achieving a sales goal, being loyal to a company or being recognized by their employer for their accomplishments. They can then redeem those points on our marketplace technology platform for hedonic merchandise or experiences.

We are now expanding our marketplace to include rewards aimed at personal and professional development and believe Coursera would be an inspiring inclusion.  

We have 5.4 million users earning points on our technology platforms. BI WORLDWIDE is a global business with its world headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota but we have offices throughout the states and around the world. 

I?d like to set up a time to discuss how we could mutually benefit one another. For more information on BIW visit https://www.biworldwide.com/about-us/."

2.We have a learning platform, called ?Eklavya? where we shall be hosting Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offered on reputed platforms. All our executives can access these courses, pay directly to the MOOC and claim reimbursement from the company.
3.By the end of 2024, we estimate that a minimum of 5000 executives will avail these courses. We further estimate that the requirement will double to 10,000 courses by the end of 2025. We are confident that IOCL will be the biggest Indian Customer for Coursera.
4.Since validation and verification of individual claims from such large number of employees is a bottleneck, what we are primarily looking from Coursera is some form of validation of employee claims through a Monthly Information System (MIS).
5.We have formed a team to discuss these aspects with the MOOC providers. We have completed discussion with a couple of MOOC providers already, and their courses will be shortly available in the Eklavya portal.

Junto con saludar, soy Sebastián Aravena, analista de capacitación de OTEC ACHS de Chile, y les comento que estamos en la búsqueda de parner para la venta e impartición de cursos. Como contexto, las mutualidades en Chile son las empresas que administran un seguro de accidentes laborales obligatorio. En este contexto, ACHS es la más grande, con 4 millones de afiliados y más de 80 mil empresas. 
 
Por motivos de la ley, como mutualidad debemos realizar capacitaciones. Hoy contamos con una plataforma de capacitación, pero estamos en proceso de modificación de sus prestaciones y características, por lo que buscamos aumentar los casi 50 mil usuarios activos mensuales que tenemos actualmente.

Por lo mismo, estamos buscando un parner en contenido, es decir, que nos facilite la posibilidad de diversificar y ampliar nuestra oferta.

En este contexto, me gustaría saber con quién podríamos explorar la posibilidad de una alianza o convenio que nos permita alcanzar nuestros objetivos.

Quedo atento su respuesta,"
